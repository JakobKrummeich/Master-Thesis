DOCUMENTATION OF SIMULATIONS

on c2 cluster at /home1/krummeich/simulation/semi_gcmc_no_field/sorted_data we store the simulation data.

short description of simulations done:

finer_density_scan_3132003: simulations for phase diagrams with N=1000 and epsAB=0.5 for different densities (might be distorted due to wrong most traveled particle distance tracking)

epsilon_scan_3132046: simulations for phase diagrams with average density 0.6 and epsAB > 0.5 (might be distorted due to wrong most traveled particle distance tracking)

epsilon_scan_3132187: simulations for phase diagrams with average density 0.6 and epsAB < 0.5 (might be distorted due to wrong most traveled particle distance tracking)

finite_size_scaling_no_field: simulations with different Number of particles (500,1000,2000,4000,8000,16000) average density=0.6, epsAB=0.1, 300000 MCSweeps per run, 20 runs per temperature, temperature interval 0.02, temperature start 1.0, temperature end 0.52. per N and temperature 1000 configurations were saved.
