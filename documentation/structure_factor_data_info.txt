DOCUMENTATION OF STRUCTURE FACTOR DATA

in 'data_analysis/structure_factor_analysis/analyzed_data' we collect the computated structure factor data

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ StructureFactors_0 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	- computed structure factors belonging to cmc_simulations from states of 'structure_factors_avgdens=0.75_1'


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ StructureFactors_AdHoc +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	- various structure factor results, for example dropping the grid symmetry in choosing k-vectors ('alternative')


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+++ StructureFactors_1 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	- computed structure factors belonging to cmc_simulations from states of 'structure_factors_avgdens=0.75_long_runs_1'
	- where the temperatures with T > Tc were simulated and the runtime was at a maximum that the cluster allowed
	- only the final 20 states per temperature were saved
	- this was done since the data in 'StructureFactors_0' was not satisfactory and it was tried to improve upon that
