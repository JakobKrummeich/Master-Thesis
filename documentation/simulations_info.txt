DOCUMENTATION OF SIMULATIONS

on c2 cluster at /home1/krummeich/simulation/semi_gcmc_no_field/sorted_data we store the simulation data.

short description of simulations done:

semi_gcmc_no_field:

	- finer_density_scan_3132003: simulations for phase diagrams with N=1000 and epsAB=0.5 for different densities (might be distorted due to wrong most traveled particle distance tracking)

	- epsilon_scan_3132046: simulations for phase diagrams with average density 0.6 and epsAB > 0.5 (might be distorted due to wrong most traveled particle distance tracking)

	- epsilon_scan_3132187: simulations for phase diagrams with average density 0.6 and epsAB < 0.5 (might be distorted due to wrong most traveled particle distance tracking)

	- finite_size_scaling_no_field: simulations with different Number of particles (500,1000,2000,4000,8000,16000) average density=0.6, epsAB=0.1, 300000 MCSweeps per run, 20 runs per temperature, temperature interval 0.02, temperature start 1.0, temperature end 0.52. per N and temperature 1000 configurations were saved.

	- additionally, there was a second run with the SAME density a smaller temperature interval of 0.62 to 0.58 with a stepsize of 0.002. Only 1 state per run and temperature was saved for this. the density stayed the same. RunNumberOffSet was set to 20. There were 100000 "throw-away/equilibration" sweeps after changing to a new temperature to improve the equilibration.

	- a third run was done with an average density of 0.75 also for the same number of particles as stated above. There were 100000 equilibration runs. the temperature window was set to 1.0 - 0.6 with a stepsize of 0.02. RunNumberOffset was set to 0. 20 starting configurations were sampled per system size. 200 states per temperature and system size were saved.

pressure_mc, N=1000, epsAB = 0.1:
	- T=0.6_first_scan: scans at a fixed temperature, with pmax = 4.0 and and stepsize of deltap = 0.1. NumberOfSweeps per pressure = 20000, no initial throw away runs for equilibration, i.e. all data was taken. these runs were not done all at once, but there were starting states in between which might be the reason that there is a jump in the data at p=2 since we started a new run at this pressure

	- multiple_Ts_second_scan: scans at multiple fixed temperatures with pmax = 4.0, pmin = 1.0, deltap = 0.05. NumberOfSweeps per pressure = 30000, 10000 initial throw away runs for equilibration. Tmax = 1.0, Tmin = 0.5, T stepsize = 0.025
